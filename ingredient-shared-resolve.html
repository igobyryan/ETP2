            <p class="lead">A community's shared understanding of a problem and how to address it is essential for effective action, including a common recognition of the issue and its causes, a shared vision of possible solutions, a collective sense of ownership over decisions, and a united commitment to follow through. While outside ideas can inspire action, it is ultimately the community's collective experience, decision-making, manpower, and financial resources that drive meaningful progress.</p>

            <!-- RECOGNIZE IT -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>Recognize It</h2>
                <p>The checklist below will help you to recognize what facets of community resolve you already have, so that you can amplify what exists, and either build or work around what does not exist.</p>

                <ul class="checklist">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Do you have a formal or informal body for addressing your crisis that involves stakeholders from various parts of the community?</strong>
                        <p>Having community members with a range of skills and experience at the decision making table takes advantage of the whole community's knowledge. It also broadens support for actions that require substantial commitment and sacrifice, and provides the financial and labor resources to carry out the actions.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Do your decision makers have a process for choosing actions that all can agree upon and participate in carrying it out?</strong>
                        <p>A real sense of collective ownership of decisions is needed for the risks involved in taking action, and the commitment of time, labor or financial resources needed to carry it out. A strong decision making body provides ways for all members to contribute, commits to finding common ground, and supports those members taking the greatest risks to their livelihood, so that they can participate.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Do your decision makers have a shared understanding of what the problem is and how it occurred?</strong>
                        <p>Choosing a course of action requires a shared vision of the nature and source of the crisis, so that actions are directed at core problems. Gathering the knowledge, memories, and experience of the community allows decision makers to map the events that triggered the vicious cycle of decline.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Has your group determined key actions that, if successfully carried out, may be powerful enough to reverse the cycle of decline?</strong>
                        <p>Many changes are possible, but not all are powerful enough to set change in motion. By mapping which elements of your vicious cycle are changeable, and brainstorming what can be done to change that element, it becomes easier to see which actions are both doable and potentially impactful enough. Any action that does not have enough force is just swimming against the current.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Is the community committed to the action?</strong>
                        <p>Although ideas stimulating action may come from outside, the community needs to move forward with its own decisions, manpower, and financial resources.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

It brings a breadth of knowledge, memory, and experience to the table to help understand shared problems and imagine solutions.

This requires planning inclusive strategies for contribution, so that everyone has a functional role that matches their abilities or resources. Recognizing that any course of action will require greater manpower or economic risk for certain community members, it is important to develop avenues to support those members taking the greatest risks to their livelihood.

                        <p>There are a wide range of community members who have specialized knowledge about your crisis, including scientists, educators, elders, those working or managing the land, those involved in managing household resources. By reaching out to them to pool their experience with the crisis, you create a strong foundation for mapping problems and solutions. It also builds a base of community members who are now involved with your work and helps identify individuals who may have the time, commitment, and disposition for joining forces to make decisions.</p>

                <h2>Work Around It</h2>
                <p>Shared Community Resolve is essential for turning around an ecological crisis endangering a community. Reversing ecological decline can only happen if many people risk changing how they manage the land that supports them. Since committing to changing their behavior may place real burdens on people and even threaten their immediate livelihood and security, enough people need to feel commitment because they share a vision of what has gone wrong and how to fix it.</p>

                <p>Challenges to working together are situation-dependent, but there are some common obstacles. Here are strategies for mitigating lack of Community Resolve:</p>

                        <p>Ideology, morals, and even reasons for wanting change are common obstacles to collaborating on addressing shared problems.
