                            <p>Having stakeholders bringing diverse knowledge, experience, and skills to the decision making table. It also broadens support for actions that require substantial commitment and sacrifice, and provides the financial and labor resources to carry out the actions.</p>

                            <p>All members supporting a course of action is an important foundation for the sacrifices involved in change and commitment of time, labor or financial resources needed to carry it out. A strong decision making body has ways to include dissenting opinions, provide ways for all members to contribute, and support those members taking the greatest risks to their livelihood.</p>

                            <p>Choosing a course of action requires a shared vision of the nature and source of the crisis, so that actions are directed at core problems.

                            <p>Many small changes are possible, but not all are powerful enough to set change in motion.

Any action that does not have enough force is just swimming against the current.</p>

                <h2>Work Around It</h2>
                <p>Shared Community Resolve is essential for turning around an ecological crisis endangering a community. Reversing ecological decline can only happen if many people risk changing how they manage the land that supports them. Since committing to changing their behavior may threaten their immediate livelihood and security, it cannot happen successfully without enough people having a shared vision of the problem and what to do about it. If it does not seem possible, continue trying to bridge these gaps of understanding, so they may join in the hard work of building <strong>Harmony Between Community and Nature</strong>.</p>

                <p>Challenges to working together are situation-dependent, but there are some common obstacles. Here are strategies for mitigating lack of Community Resolve:</p>
