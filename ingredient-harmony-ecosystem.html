            <p class="lead">Lasting restoration happens when a community builds or revives the social organization needed to care for its ecosystem — and the ecosystem responds by better meeting community needs. Rules, institutions, and practices evolve to match what the land or water actually requires. As ecosystem health improves, it reinforces the social commitment that made restoration possible. Social and environmental gains go hand in hand. At the heart of this process is what researchers call "social commons for environmental commons" — organization tailored to managing a community's shared ecological resources.</p>

            <!-- RECOGNIZE IT -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>Recognize It</h2>
                <p>The checklist below will help you recognize what elements of social-ecological harmony you already have, so that you can amplify what exists, and either build or work around what does not.</p>

                <ul class="checklist">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Does your community have formal or informal rules governing how people use shared natural resources?</strong>
                        <p>Rules about fishing, forest use, water rights, or land management — even informal ones — are the foundation of social-ecological harmony. Their existence signals that the community already understands it has shared stakes in a shared resource.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Are those rules based on how the ecosystem actually works, rather than external regulations imposed from outside?</strong>
                        <p>Rules that come from community knowledge of local conditions tend to be more practical to enforce and more effective in practice. Outside regulations often miss the specific dynamics of a local ecosystem.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Do the people who depend most directly on the ecosystem have a voice in how it's managed?</strong>
                        <p>Fishers, farmers, herders, and water users have detailed knowledge of how their ecosystem behaves. When their experience is incorporated into management decisions, those decisions are more likely to fit the system they're managing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Is there a shared understanding that community wellbeing and ecosystem health rise and fall together?</strong>
                        <p>The recognition that healthy fisheries mean food security, that healthy forests mean water supply, that healthy soil means family income — this shared understanding is what motivates people to accept the costs and constraints of collective management.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>When the ecosystem improves, does the community notice and connect it to their actions?</strong>
                        <p>Visible feedback — more fish, cleaner water, better harvests — closes the loop between community behavior and ecological response, reinforcing both the rules and the social institutions that produced the improvement.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- AMPLIFY IT -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>Amplify It</h2>
                <p>If elements of social-ecological harmony are already in place, here are strategies for strengthening them.</p>

                <div class="strategy-list">
                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>Strengthen the fit between your rules and your ecosystem</h4>
                        <p>If management rules exist but outcomes are mixed, look carefully at whether the rules match the way the ecosystem actually functions. Overfishing limits set without understanding fish reproduction cycles, or water restrictions that don't account for seasonal variation, will underperform even with strong community commitment. Incorporate ecological knowledge — from scientists, from elders, from direct observation — into refining how the rules work.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>Make the connection between social and environmental gains visible</h4>
                        <p>When ecosystem recovery produces tangible community benefits — more fish, better water, higher yields — document and communicate those connections explicitly. The more clearly people can see that their collective management choices are producing results, the stronger the social institutions become. Before/after documentation, community site visits, and shared celebration of visible recovery all reinforce the feedback loop.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>Evolve your social institutions as the ecosystem changes</h4>
                        <p>A social commons that fits your ecosystem today may need adjustment as conditions change — whether from climate variability, successful recovery that changes what management is needed, or new external pressures. Build in regular opportunities for the community to reassess whether their rules and institutions still fit the system they're managing.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>Connect management authority to those doing the managing</h4>
                        <p>When the people who enforce the rules are the same people who depend on the ecosystem, compliance tends to be higher and enforcement more effective. Decentralized, community-based management outperforms top-down regulation in most EcoTipping Point stories — not because government is unimportant, but because local authority aligned with local stakes creates stronger accountability.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- BUILD IT -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>Build It</h2>
                <p>If social-ecological harmony doesn't yet exist, here are strategies for creating it.</p>

                <div class="strategy-list">
                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>Start with the ecosystem's actual needs</h4>
                        <p>Before designing management systems, spend time understanding how your ecosystem works — what drives its decline, what conditions it needs to recover, what pressures it can absorb and what it cannot. This ecological understanding is the foundation for building social organization that fits.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>Revive or adapt traditional institutions</h4>
                        <p>Many communities have historical forms of collective management that were abandoned or undermined — traditional water councils, fishing agreements, forest stewardship practices. These institutions often encode generations of ecological knowledge about local conditions. Where they still exist in memory, adapting them to current conditions is frequently more effective than building new institutions from scratch.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>Create new institutions modeled on the ecosystem's logic</h4>
                        <p>Where traditional institutions don't exist or can't be revived, design new ones that reflect how the ecosystem functions. The Apo Island marine sanctuary succeeded in part because the boundary of community management matched the actual boundaries of the reef ecosystem the community depended on. Form follows ecological function.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>Ensure those who bear the costs also share the benefits</h4>
                        <p>Harmony between community and ecosystem breaks down when the costs of conservation fall on one group while the benefits flow to another. Build benefit-sharing into your management structure from the beginning — whether through equitable water rights, shared fishing revenues, or community ownership of ecotourism income.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- WORK AROUND IT -->
            <div class="content-block">
                <h2>Work Around It</h2>
                <p>When social-ecological harmony is difficult to establish, these strategies can help navigate common obstacles.</p>

                <div class="strategy-list">
                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>When external authority undermines local management</h4>
                        <p>Government regulations, outside commercial interests, or national protected area designations can override community management systems, sometimes unintentionally. If this is a barrier, focus first on documenting your community's management practices and outcomes — evidence of success is the strongest argument for local authority. Look for legal frameworks, co-management agreements, or recognition of indigenous resource rights that can formalize community control.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>When the ecosystem is too degraded to respond quickly</h4>
                        <p>If the ecosystem has been so severely depleted that initial management efforts show little result, community resolve can erode before the social-ecological feedback loop has a chance to form. In this situation, pair conservation rules with active restoration — replanting, habitat rehabilitation, species reintroduction — to accelerate the ecosystem's response and create visible early wins that reinforce the social institutions.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="strategy-item">
                        <h4>When there's no history of collective resource management</h4>
                        <p>Some communities have individualized resource use so thoroughly — through privatization, outside takeover, or breakdown of traditional practices — that collective management feels foreign. Start with a small, defined resource that the community agrees has shared stakes. Early success with a limited commons builds the trust and institutional experience to expand.</p>

                            <p>When Apo Islanders established their marine sanctuary, they built a social commons to fit their environmental commons. Community management began with the sanctuary itself and evolved to cover all fishing grounds around the island.</p>
                            <p>The rules worked because they were designed from community knowledge of the reef — and they were practical to enforce because the people enforcing them were the same people whose livelihoods depended on the outcome.</p>

                            <p>As farmers shifted from monocropping to agroforestry, soil quality and biodiversity improved. The ecosystem began providing ample water and a healthy diet without external inputs.</p>
